This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load data
library(RCurl)
if (!exists("trainraw")) {  # Checks if data has been populated
    trainurl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
    setInternet2(use = TRUE)
    download.file(trainurl, "pml-training.csv")
    trainraw <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
}
if (!exists("testraw")) {  # Checks if data has been populated
    testurl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
    download.file(testurl, "pml-testing.csv")
    testraw <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
}
str(testraw)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
